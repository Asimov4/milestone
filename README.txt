1) Install the npm package of parse for node using the following command ."npm install parse-api" . I've used the following https://github.com/tenorviol/node-parse-api project for using parse with nodejs.

2) Make an account on parse and insert your APP_ID and MASTER_KEY in server.js file.

3) I've modified the server.js to insert new user in parse and to update his searches at parse.

4) I've also created a url to recieve the data which is saved at parse. But you've to make a call directly through the browser because we haven't discussed about it yet , what we've to do for that.

If anymore updates needed please contact me on trello. :)

Than you can view the data being saved in parse through parse dashboard.
